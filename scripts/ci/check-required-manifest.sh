# Assert every check name in .github/required-checks.txt is a job some workflow
# actually defines (ADR-002 "CI fan-in and merge queue").
#
# Without this, renaming or deleting a job leaves `ci-required` waiting for a
# check that can never appear — and the failure arrives more than an hour later
# as an opaque fan-in timeout, on a PR that has nothing to do with the rename.
# This turns that into a ten-second, specific failure in ci-guard.
#
# A matrix leg reports as `<job name> (<leg>)`, which no file contains
# literally, so a parenthesised suffix is stripped before matching the base name
# against the job id or its `name:`.
#
# PROVENANCE: adapted from the owner's Vidra meta repo
# (~/github/vidra/vidra-user/scripts/ci/check-required-manifest.sh).
# TWIN (intended): the same script in vizra-core and vizra-search. Keep in step.
