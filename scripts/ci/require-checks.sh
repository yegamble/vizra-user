# Fan-in gate (ADR-002 "CI fan-in and merge queue", VZ-CI-001): collapse this repo's several required
# workflows into ONE named check an owner can put in branch protection.
#
# GitHub cannot express `needs:` across workflows, and this repo's required
# lanes live in separate files on purpose (different services, different
# runtimes, different path filters). So the fan-in reads the checks API for the
# commit under test and enforces a CHECKED-IN manifest of what "required" means:
#
#   .github/required-checks.txt
#     name          must EXIST and must conclude `success`
#     ?name         required only IF it ran (path-filtered lanes such as
#                   schema-compat, which only trigger on migrations/ changes)
#
# Failure modes it closes:
#   * a required lane silently stops triggering (renamed job, broken `on:`,
#     an over-eager `paths:` filter) — the manifest still demands it, so the
#     fan-in fails instead of the PR merging with one fewer proof;
#   * a lane that concludes `cancelled`, `timed_out`, `neutral` or `skipped`
#     being read as "not failed" — only `success` passes here;
#   * branch protection drifting behind the workflow set — the manifest is the
#     single place both are declared;
#   * a workflow FILE GitHub rejects — a run with zero jobs produces no
#     check-run, so a `?name` lane would otherwise vanish without a trace;
#   * an API read that FAILED being taken for an answer. Every guard here is a
#     read, and a failed read returns nothing — which looks exactly like "no
#     rejected files" or "not triggered, optional". So a poll in which ANY
#     call failed decides nothing: it is retried, and a read still failing at
#     the deadline fails the gate as "GitHub API unavailable";
#   * one check name appearing twice on a commit — see "Which check-run
#     decides" below;
#   * a `?name` lane read as "not triggered" while the run that would create
#     its check-run is still queued — see the `missing` verdict below;
#   * this token's own rate limit (1,000 requests an hour PER REPOSITORY,
#     shared with every sibling job) read as an outage — see `rate_limit_wait`.
#
# It deliberately does NOT create or modify branch protection. The owner
# configures exactly one required check, `ci-required`, per repo.
#
# PROVENANCE: adapted from the owner's Vidra meta repo
# (~/github/vidra/vidra-user/scripts/ci/require-checks.sh), which ADR-002 cites
# as the precedent for this mechanism. The incidents named in the comments
# below are VIDRA's, recorded there; they are kept because they are the reason
# each guard exists, and they are not Vizra history.
#
# TWIN (intended): vizra-core, vizra-search and the vizra meta repo carry the
# same file and the same job. This copy lands first; keep the copies byte-
# identical as they appear, and change them together with the regression suite
# beside this file (scripts/ci/require-checks_test.sh).
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN (checks:read + actions:read), GITHUB_REPOSITORY, CHECK_SHA (the
# full commit SHA), DEADLINE_MINUTES, POLL_SECONDS. MAX_POLLS is TEST-ONLY: it
# gives up after that many polls as if the deadline had passed, so the test
# can script an outage without waiting real minutes. CI never sets it.

# --- Which check-run decides --------------------------------------------------
# One name can carry several check-runs on one commit. Every workflow run is
# its own check suite, so a re-opened PR, a second event on the same SHA or a
# second release leaves the old runs beside the new ones — Vidra's
# vidra-search 1f8b8542 has two `publish` runs from two `release` events. (A
# re-run ATTEMPT stays in its suite, where this endpoint's default
# `filter=latest` already shows only the newest attempt — Vidra's vidra-core
# 13e5d04.) Taking whichever row the
# API listed first let an older success hide a newer failure. The rule, per name:
#   1. only check-runs created by GitHub Actions count — another app's check
#      that happens to share a lane's name proves nothing about that lane;
#   2. if ANY of them is not completed, wait — the lane is still being decided;
#   3. group them by the workflow FILE that ran them (check suite -> run path).
#      Within one file the NEWEST WORKFLOW RUN decides (highest run id), not
#      the newest check-run: re-running an OLDER, superseded run mints a newer
#      check-run id inside that old run's suite, and it must not beat the newer
#      run's failure. Walking the file's runs newest first, the first run that
#      carries this check-run OR is not completed decides. A newer run still
#      queued or running with no check-run for the lane yet means wait — the
#      old result is not the answer, the new job may be about to fail. A
#      completed run without the lane (cancelled before its jobs existed) is
#      passed over. So a later run supersedes an older failure, a run cancelled
#      by a newer one does not block it, and a lane that finished while other
#      jobs of its run are still going is decided now;
#   4. every file's deciding run must succeed. Two different files defining the
#      same job name are two proofs, and a success in one must not hide a
#      failure in the other. A check-run whose workflow run is not listed is
#      its own group — stricter, never looser.
# A lane with NO check-run at all is "missing" — unless it is optional and
# some workflow run on the commit is still queued or in progress. GitHub
# creates a job's check-run when the job starts, not when the run is created,
# so for the first seconds of a run its lanes do not exist yet, and an absent
# `?name` read at that moment as "not triggered" is exactly the fail-open this
# manifest syntax exists to avoid (Vidra's vidra-search#44 printed it 1.1 s
# after starting). Nothing says WHICH file an absent lane belongs to, so any
# run still going holds it pending. Every run completes, so it converges —
# except the run doing the asking: this gate's own run is in progress for as
# long as this script runs, so it is left out (by run id and by workflow
# file, so a second ci-required run on the same commit cannot hold this one).
# decide NAME OPTIONAL prints "missing", "pending <why>", "success" or
# "failed <conclusion> (<file>)[; ...]". Anything else is treated as a failure.

  # check-run at all, so the lane simply vanishes from the manifest's point of

  # every push from 2026-09-08 to 2026-09-10 with that gate green. Zero jobs plus a

  # or not the manifest lists the lane.
