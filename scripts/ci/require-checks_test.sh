# Regression suite for scripts/ci/require-checks.sh, the `ci-required` fan-in.
#
# PROVENANCE: adapted from the owner's Vidra meta repo
# (~/github/vidra/vidra-user/scripts/ci/require-checks_test.sh). The QA review
# and the scenarios it describes are Vidra's, not Vizra's.
#
# TWIN (intended): vizra-core, vizra-search and the vizra meta repo carry the
# same suite beside the same script. Change the copies together.
#
# Why it exists: the fan-in is the ONE check branch protection trusts, so every
# way it can mis-read the API is a way for a PR to merge with a proof missing.
# A QA review drove it with a stub `gh` and found it exiting 0 when the reads
# behind its guards failed, when a paginated read died half way, when a
# zero-job run concluded `startup_failure`, and when a lane had two check-runs
# of one name (whichever row came first won). Nothing re-ran those scenarios,
# so any later edit could have reopened them with every check green.
#
# How: a stub `gh`, first on PATH, answers each call from RAW JSON fixtures and
# applies the script's own `--jq` filter with the real jq, so the filters are
# under test and not only the shell around them. A fixture file may hold
# several JSON documents, one per page: with `--paginate` the filter runs over
# every page, without it only the first page is seen, as with the real gh.
# `<kind>.<n>` answers only the n-th call of a kind, `<kind>` every other one;
# a matching `.rc` file sets the exit code (with an HTTP-ish error on stderr,
# or the text of a matching `.err` file), and `<kind>.pages` stops output after
# that many pages, like a paginated read that dies part way.
#
# Needs bash (3.2 is enough) and jq. Nothing here skips: a missing tool fails.
#
#   bash scripts/ci/require-checks_test.sh
#   REQUIRE_CHECKS_SCRIPT=/other/copy.sh bash scripts/ci/require-checks_test.sh
#
# The override runs the suite against another copy, e.g. an older revision to
# show which cases it fails.
